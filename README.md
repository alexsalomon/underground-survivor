underground-survivor
====================

Underground Survivor is a project I worked on during the winter of 2012. The idea was to create a game from scratch, designing not only the game logic, but also the entire game engine and the graphics. Although most of the basic functionality such as player control, graphical rendering, animation system and artificial intelligence has already been implemented, the game is still a prototype, and, as such, some of the graphics were taken from other websites, which I cite at the bottom of the page.            This project reflects my desire to develop games and to understand how they work underneath the hood: their physics, mechanics and the challenges involved in making them. While developing this game, I used a full object oriented approach, keeping code readability, re-usability and maintainability as my priority. It currently consists of 62 classes, each ranging from 20 to 320 lines (including spaces) and a wide variety of design patterns. When I first started, I barely knew C++ or how to create a project inside Visual Studio 2010. I have come a long way from looking up tutorials online on how to create a Win32 application and display a window to the screen to have produced a fully functional game.
